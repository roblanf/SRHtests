# SRH analysis pipeline

1. run ```start_over.sh``` to clean out any old results

2. run ```srh.py``` to get SRH stats and IQtree input files for all datasets in raw_data

3. run ```run_iqtree.sh``` to run IQ tree on all the folders from 2 (everything in ```processed_data/IQtree```)

4. run ```tree_dist.r``` this creates ```processed_data/tree_distances.csv``` which is a CSV file of tree-to-tree path distances comparing all three trees generated from each of the tree tests for each dataset. 

5. get all the results of the topology comparisons 

6. Generate a table that contains the percentage of the Bad and Not-Bad character sets in each data set by running "charsets_percentage.py"

7. Generate a table that contains the length of each character set in each data set by running "charset_length.py"

8. Generate a table that divides the character sets into two categories: one that rejects the null hypothesis and one that does not, by running "is_charset_bad.py"

9. Generate a table that contains the lengths of the trees generated by IQtree from each partition and test of symmetry by running "trees_lengths.py"

10. Generate a table that contains all the topology tests results by running "topology_tests.py"
